# Password Generator Fatma

This assignment requires me to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. 

This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I write. 

It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. See the list here:

[list of Password Special Characters from the OWASP Foundation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

## Instructions

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
* Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of password: At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
    * Character types: Lowercase, Uppercase, Numeric and Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
* Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
* Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page
